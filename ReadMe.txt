The code will first find the sum of the first n and m numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, then it will find the GDC of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.


How to compile and run:
first open the command line and go to the directory where the Main.java file is stored.
Then run the command javac Main.java to compile the file.
Once compiled you can then execute the code with Main a b where a and b are integer inputs. e.g Main 3 4, This will give the output:
The sum of the first 3 Fibonacci numbers is 2
The sum of the first 4 Fibonacci numbers is 4
The GCD of the two numbers is 2
